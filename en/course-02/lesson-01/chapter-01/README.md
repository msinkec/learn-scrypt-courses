# Chapter 1: Course Overview


In this course, weâ€™re going to build a zkSNARKs-based battleship game on the BitcoinSV network in those main steps:


* Creating a dedicated zero-knowledge-proof circuit by using the Zokrates toolkit;
* Creating an sCrypt smart contract to run the game on chain;
* Add a user-friendly UI;

By the end of the course, you could be familiar with all the main concepts and techniques we used in this project and be able to create your own zero-knowledge app on the BitcoinSV network.
