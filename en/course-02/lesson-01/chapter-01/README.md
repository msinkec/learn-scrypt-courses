# Chapter 1: Course Overview


In this course, we are going to build a zkSNARK-based [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) game on Bitcoin in three steps:


1. Create a zero-knowledge-proof circuit by using the [Zokrates](https://zokrates.github.io) or [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/) toolkit;
2. Create an sCrypt smart contract to run the game on chain;
3. Add a user-friendly UI to interact with the contract.

By the end of the course, you should be familiar with all the main concepts and techniques needed to build a ZK-based browser Battleship game, and be able to create your own ZK apps on Bitcoin.
