# Chapter 3: Setup the development environment

## Install nodejs

Same development environment as [TypeScript](https://nodejs.org/en/download), just install `Node.js` (`version >= 16`) and ` npm`.


## IDE

For development tools, we recommend using Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## `scrypt-cli` CLI

`scrypt-cli` is a CLI tool that makes `sCrypt` development faster and easier.

## Create Project

Use `scrypt-cli` CLI to create a project:

```bash
npx scrypt-cli project tic-tac-toe
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
cd tic-tac-toe
npm install
```


## Compiling contracts

```bash
npx scrypt-cli  compile
```

## Put it to the test

Find the `TicTacToe` contract created by `scrypt-cli`. And delete the methods and attributes generated by default, leaving only an empty class. Next, we implement the `TicTacToe` contract step by step.
