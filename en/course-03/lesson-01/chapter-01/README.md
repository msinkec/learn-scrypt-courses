# Chapter 1: Course overview

In this course, you will learn how to use sCrypt to build a Tic-Tac-Toe dApp on Bitcoin.

The application is very simple. It uses the Bitcoin addresses of two players (Alice and Bob respectively) to initialize the contract. They each bet the same amount and lock it into the contract. The winner takes all bitcoins locked in the contract. If no one wins and there is a draw, the two players can each withdraw half of the money.

We will build in two steps:

1. Setup the development environment
2. Write the contract
3. Add a frontend integrating the contract
